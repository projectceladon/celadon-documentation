Run Project |C| on IntelÂ® architectures
=======================================

The following diagrams illustrate the overall |C| software architecture.
|C| is designed to be fully compliant with Google* Android* compatibility definitions,
ensuring affinity and security of applications running on the stack.
The *Auto Adaptation Framework* (**AAF**) is the key component that makes Celadon unique.
It automatically detects and binds system kernel drivers, and loads
the :abbr:`HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)` modules and configurations
for a variety of devices exposed on Intel platforms.
Therefore, whether running Android applications in virtual machines (VMs)
or containers, they are all served by a single Celadon image with a unified
architecture, accelerating development of broad workload consolidation
use cases from Edge to Cloud.

   early Pre-Production CiV release for evaluation and development purposes.
