:Q:
    What is the new Project Celadon release?
:A:
    The new Project |C| release refers to the source code that makes up
    the September 2019 Project |C| Release (**20-Sept-2019**). While Project |C|
    has long supported Android* on bare metal deployments using Intel速 architecture,
    there was no support for containerized or virtualized deployments of Android
    on Intel architecture. The |C| community is filling that gap with
    the September release, which allows one Android image to be deployed
    across Bare Metal (BM), Virtual Machines (VM) and Containers on Intel
    architectures. |C| source code can be used across a variety of Intel
    hardware, including
    `Intel速 NUC Kit NUC6CAYH <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc6cayh.html>`_
    - the leading platform for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) configurations.
    Please check out :ref:`release_notes` for detailed new release features.

:Q:
    Why might developers and independent software vendors want to use Celadon
    in VM or Celadon in Container?
:A:
    The new Project |C| packaging will still take only one step to install,
    and in addition to gaining VM and container support for Android on
    Intel architecture, developers and :abbr:`ISVs (Independent Software Vendors)`
    will continue experiencing:

        * Open platform enabling helping developers speed time to market across
          a variety of infrastructures
        * Compliance with the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), as well as
          `additional test suites <https://01.org/projectceladon/documentation/tutorials/test-strategy>`_
          on leading platforms and configurations
        * Functionality across a
          `variety of Intel hardware <https://01.org/projectceladon/documentation/getting_started/as-service>`_,
          including `Intel速 NUC Kit NUC6CAYH <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc6cayh.html>`_
          - the leading platform for in vehicle infotainment (IVI) configurations
        * Rich vertical solution configurations allowing for ease of scalability and extensibility across market segments

:Q:
    What are the differences between Celadon in VM and Celadon in Container deployments?
:A:
    Celadon VM and Container deployments differ in a few ways. First, Celadon in VM deployments include Celadon as the guest operating system, running in a virtual machine, in a virtualized environment. In comparison, Celadon in Container runs in a hosted Linux* container, in a containerized environment.

    Another difference between the two deployment methods is in **security**. Celadon in VM provides a stronger separation between guest VMs and the virtual machine monitor, leading to superior component isolation vs containerized solutions. As an example, if a malfunctioning application causes a hang in the guest operating system kernel in a Celadon in VM deployment, only the guest OS kernel will be affected. In comparison, a malfunctioning application causing an issue to the OS kernel in a Celadon in Container deployment may affect all Celadon container instances.

    One last difference between the two deployment types is related to resource consumption and **density**. Typically, containerized deployments can run at higher densities as compared to virtualized or bare metal deployments. Celadon in VM deployments typically have moderate densities. Initial performance perspectives show minimal performance differences between VM and container instances at Edge levels of workload consolidation.

:Q:
    Can |C| still be run on bare metal?
:A:
    Intel supports VM and Container configurations for |C|. Users can potentially
    take the opensource |C| project and run in different configurations including
    Native.

    .. note::
        Users should be aware that test suites provided by Google may not
        pass with 100% scoring if deploying |C| on bare metal systems.
        While |C| in VM deployments are supported by `Google Mobile Services (GMS)
        <https://www.android.com/gms/>`_, Celadon on bare metal does not have
        GMS support. Dedicated use cases like retail, client, education and
        gaming do not need GMS. If there is a need for GMS while running
        |C| on bare metal, direct communication with Google will be necessary.

:Q:
    What are some example use cases and workload/applications that benefit from this latest release?
:A:
    `Digital Signage <https://01.org/projectceladon/digital-signage>`_
    and Secure Payment solutions are ideal for virtualized deployments, due to the high security and scalability virtualized deployments provide. With Celadon in VM, however, developers and ISVs can continue utilizing Intel速 hardware acceleration while having the flexibility to customize to the latest Android applications. In comparison, Cloud gaming applications are ideal for Celadon in Container deployments. Cloud gaming requires high performance and high densities - two things containerized Android excels at.

    Overall, bare metal, virtual machine and containerized workloads are pervasive. Customers demand support for each workload deployment type - particularly for Android workloads. The latest Celadon release allows developers and ISV's to consolidate workloads under one image, leading to boundless opportunities to provide broad market support.

:Q:
    Where can I learn more about Celadon in VM or Celadon in Containers?
:A:
    There are many ways users can learn more, starting with accessing release notes and
    `software <https://github.com/projectCeladon>`_. Users can learn more by subscribing to the
    `Project Celadon mailing list <https://lists.01.org/postorius/lists/celadon.lists.01.org>`_.
    Mailing list subscribers are kept up to date on the latest Celadon releases, updates and tools. Subscribers are also invited to Project Celadon focused events, like our monthly
    `Technical Community Meetings <https://01.org/projectceladon/community#technical-community-meetings>`_, which provide a space for discussion around Celadon technical topics.

:Q:
    **What license(s) does Celadon use?**
:A:
    |C| consists of permissive and copyleft licenses such as BSD, MIT, Apache and GPL licenses. Use, reproduction and distribution of components of |C| licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license. Please refer and comply to the open source software license found in the source code files or repositories. Certain licenses such as Google Mobile Services or Widevine are not included in |C|.

:Q:
    **What Android desserts are supported in Celadon?**
:A:
    The latest Android dessert is supported as soon as Google publicly releases the dessert. Please see the :ref:`release_notes` for the latest supported desserts.

:Q:
    **Will the latest Celadon work on older hardware that was previously supported?**
:A:
    |C| supports a variety of reference platforms, in addition to being device
    independent. Developers have the option to use an older manifest file to
    build an image for previously supported hardware, but |C|'s main focus
    is enabling on the latest Intel platforms. As such, support on older
    platforms may be limited.

:Q:
    **How could I start adding software components to my own Celadon build?**
:A:
    |C| follows the same practice as Android for adding software components to the build.

:Q:
    **I would like to contribute. Would Intel accept my contributions?**
:A:
    Yes, we welcome contributions! Since Intel is responsible for the product management and core stack of |C|, what ultimately is accepted is at the maintainers' discretion. We will determine if it's a good fit, then contributions will go through a review and verification process in order to maintain quality.
