How to support secure boot
**************************

Secure boot is enabled on the BIOS of some PCs by default. It adds the BIOS
vendor's key and Windows\* key by default. However, the default setting does
not include the key to verify the kernelflinger. If the BIOS has enabled
secure boot, you will get the following error message:

You'll need a USB drive with at least 1GB of free space to perform the
following steps to add the key used to verify the kernelflinger
to BIOS.

#. Download the files that comprise *Keytool* from their respective
   locations:

   #. :file:`KeyTool.efi` is a tool included in the *efitools* tarball. 
      Download the tarball from
      https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/efitools.git.

   #. Download 
      `DB.auth <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectceladon/celadon-documentation/master/blob/DB.auth>`_.

   #. Download
      `KEK.auth <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectceladon/celadon-documentation/master/blob/KEK.auth>`_.

#. Format the USB drive to use the FAT filesystem. Put the
   :file:`KeyTool.efi`, :file:`DB.auth`, and :file:`KEK.auth` files on the
   USB drive.

#. Disable the device secure boot. 

   #. Plug in the USB drive and reboot the device.
   #. Press :kbd:`F10` to enter the Boot Menu. 
   #. Select "UEFI : Build-in EFI Shell" and then find your USB device.
   #. Execute :command:`KeyTool.efi` and you will see the KeyTool menu.
   #. Select :menuselection:`Edit Keys` to replace the keys.

How to change the partition size in |C| image
*********************************************

An Android system is typically comprised of multiple disk partitions. Each
parition is associated with an :file:`\*.img` file in the |C| image. In
addition, |C| supports a whole GPT image to be flashed to the entire disk.
Some partitions (e.g. the system partition) are huge, but some of them are
empty. The :command:`SPARSE` image format is used to reduce the image size.

The default partition size is defined in the following files:

    .. list-table::

       * - device/intel/mixins/groups/boot-arch/project-celadon/gpt.ini
       * - device/intel/mixins/groups/boot-arch/project-celadon/option.spec
       * - device/intel/mixins/groups/vendor-partition/true/option.spec
       * - device/intel/mixins/groups/config-partition/true/gpt.ini
       * - device/intel/mixins/groups/factory-partition/true/gpt.ini

Modify :file:`device/intel/project-celadon/[lunch_target]/mixins.spec` to
change some of the default settings.

.. note::
    1. Changing the partition size will cause the OTA update to fail.
    2. The system partition requires at least 2560MB of disk space.
