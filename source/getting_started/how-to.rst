How to enable live boot
-----------------------

The live boot feature allows you to flash a live boot image to a USB disk, and then boot from this USB disk to Android directly without installing Android to the internal storage first.

The live boot feature is used only for debug purposes, and it must be built with the **eng** or **userdebug** build flavors.

For |C| we build a **GPT** disk image, flash it to a USB disk (just like we install Android to the USB disk), and then boot Android from the USB disk. With this approach, |C| supports all Android features except some security features that need hardware binding.

In general, use the following steps to live-boot the |C|:

#. Build a live boot image.

    Follow the general steps to prepare for the local development, and download the source code. Append the build option '**KERNELFLINGER_SUPPORT_USB_STORAGE=true**' when you build the images. This option enables the kernelflinger to support loading Android from a USB disk, and is needed to support USB live boot.

    Use the following command to build a live boot image:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ make SPARSE_IMG=true KERNELFLINGER_SUPPORT_USB_STORAGE=true gptimage -j $(nproc)

    Substitute *$(nproc)* to the appropriate value according to the CPU cores on your build server.

    After a successful build you get an *out/target/product/* **[lunch_target]/[lunch_target]** *_gptimage.img* image. For example, an *out/target/product/cel_kbl/cel_kbl_gptimage.img* image is generated for the *cel_kbl* launch target.

    This is an image of a whole GPT disk, with an image size of 14GB. To change the default image size, edit the mixins config file *device/intel/project-celadon/[luch_target]/mixins.spec* as following:

    .. code-block:: none

        gptbuild: true(size=14G,generate_craff=false)

#. Flash the live boot image to a USB disk.

    For Linux, use the ``dd`` tool to easily flash the image file to the USB disk. For example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo dd if=cel_kbl_gptimage.img of=/dev/sdc bs=1M

    .. caution::
        You **MUST** change the */dev/sdc* to the real USB disk device.

        Be sure all the buffered data is written to the USB disk before removing the USB disk (e.g. run the ``sync`` command in Linux).

    For Windows, use the ``rufus`` tool to flash the image file to the USB disk.

#. Boot from the USB disk to Android directly.

    Plug in the USB disk and power on. Then, press a function key to enter the BIOS boot menu. Select **boot** from the USB disk. Now, you can boot from the USB disk to Android directly.

    If you choose to save data to this Android device and you have not removed the USB disk, the data will be saved to the USB disk. You can then use the saved data on other computers.

    .. note::
        #. If you already installed Android in the internal storage, disable the internal storage if you are using USB live boot.
        #. If you want to use one USB disk in two computers, make sure the lock state is the same in each computer.

How to dual boot |C| and Windows
--------------------------------

You may want to install Windows and |C| Anroid on one device, and select which OS to boot every time the device is powering up. To achieve the dual boot, install Windows and |C| on two storage devices seperately.

#. Use kernelflinger UEFI executables:

    The kernelflinger UEFI installer does not prompt the target storage device to install. Disconnect the Windows installed storage device first, connect the storage back to the device after installing |C|, and then select which OS to boot from the BIOS boot menu.

How to change the partition size in |C| image
---------------------------------------------
An Android system is typically comprised of multiple disk partitions. Each parition is associated with an *\*.img* file in the |C| image. In addition, |C| supports a whole GPT image to be flashed to the entire disk.
Some partitions (e.g. the system partition) are huge, but some of them are empty. The **SPARSE** image format is used to reduce the image size.

The default partition size is defined in the following files:

    .. list-table::

        * - device/intel/mixins/groups/boot-arch/project-celadon/gpt.ini
        * - device/intel/mixins/groups/boot-arch/project-celadon/option.spec
        * - device/intel/mixins/groups/vendor-partition/true/option.spec
        * - device/intel/mixins/groups/config-partition/true/gpt.ini
        * - device/intel/mixins/groups/factory-partition/true/gpt.ini

Modify *device/intel/project-celadon/[lunch_target]/mixins.spec* to change some of the default settings.

.. note::
    1. Changing the partition size will cause the OTA update failure.
    2. The system partiton requires at least 2560MB in size.
