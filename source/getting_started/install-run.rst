          - ``celadon_ivi``, ``cel_apl``

* A HDMI PC monitor display
* A USB keyboard and a USB mouse
* A 8GB USB flash drive
* A development PC workstation running 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Linux

The firmware of your target system must support **UEFI Shell** in order to install the |C| installer images.
Proceed with the following section to setup the |NUC| device with the kernelflinger UEFI executables.

.. note::
    Android Q is supported on Intel Platforms, and the |NUC| system model NUC6CAYH is the leading platform for IVI configuration with the **celadon_ivi** lunch target.

Install using kernelflinger executables
----------------------------------------

Copy kernelflinger executables to a USB flash drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The kernelflinger installation approach does not require you to erase the content of the USB flash drive, but the USB flash drive needs to have at least a 2GB VFAT file system on it to store the kernelflinger UEFI executables. The kernelflinger executables are packaged in a *flashfile* in .ZIP format, which is available under the *out/* folder after building the |C| source code. Unzip the content of the .ZIP file to a USB flash drive before the installation.

Boot the built-in EFI Shell to bootstrap the installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The kernelflinger executables are loaded and run by the **UEFI Shell**. To enable the built-in UEFI Shell in the UEFI firmware of |NUC|, power on the device and press **F2** to enter the firmware setup menu.

Click the *Advanced* button on the *Boot Order* pane, then click the *Boot Configuration* tab to ensure the Internal UEFI Shell option is checked in the *Boot Devices* list.

On a refresh of the 7th generation |NUC| model (i.e. `Dawson Canyon <https://ark.intel.com/products/codename/126293/Dawson-Canyon>`_), if you have ever installed |C| on the |NUC| system, you can install |C| on it with `Intel Platform Flash Tool Lite <https://01.org/node/2463>`_ using Android fastboot protocol. Proceed with the instructions on the :ref:`install-using-pft` section to install |C| using |PFT|.

Save any modified configuration before rebooting the system, and press **F10** to enter the Boot Menu. Plug the USB flash drive with kernelflinger executables on it to any USB port, and select **UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell** to boot the NUC. After counting down, the UEFI Shell runs the ``startup.nsh`` script on the USB flash drive, and installs the Celadon images automatically.

Install |C| using |PFT| Lite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are installing |C| on a refresh of the 7th generation |NUC| model, to take advantage of flashing and updating the |NUC| system using fastboot protocol, make sure the firmware of the system has been updated to version 0057 or later, and the **Device Mode** option is selected for the internal USB 3.0 port header on the USB category of the Devices tab.

.. figure:: images/bios-main.jpg

You also need a USB dongle (e.g. `Dawson Canyon USB 3.0 female to 10-pin header cable <https://www.gorite.com/dawson-canyon-usb-3-0-female-to-10-pin-header-cable>`_) to exercise the internal USB 3.0 port header on the main board of the |NUC| system. Refer to the `Technical Product Specification <https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/mini-pcs/nuc-kits/NUC7i5DN_TechProdSpec.pdf>`_ to identify the USB 3.0 port header on the main board.

Save the modified configuration before rebooting the system, press **F10** to enter the Boot Menu. Select **UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell** to boot the NUC, press any key to stop the countdown timer and enter the UEFI Shell. Run the |C| loader in Fastboot mode with the following command in the UEFI shell:

.. code-block:: console

    Shell> loader -f

Once the |NUC| system boots to the Fastboot console, connect the |NUC| system to your Ubuntu development workstation with a USB Type A male to Type A male cable.

Download and install `Intel Platform Flash Tool lite <https://01.org/node/2463>`_ on the Ubuntu workstation if you havn’t done so. Launch the |PFT| Lite, the program should detect the presence of the connected |NUC| system through Fastboot protocol:

.. figure:: images/platformflashtool-lite.jpg
    :align: center

Click the **Browse** button, enter the folder contains the content of the unzipped flashfile, open the **flash.json** configuration file, and simply press the **Start to flash** button to start the installation.

.. note::
    If your |NUC| system is installed with huge disk storage (e.g. 128G, 256G, etc.), it will take very long time to wipe the data on the disk. To mitigate the long waiting, two configurations, ``Blank_without_lock`` and ``Update_without_lock``, are added to |PFT| which leave the device in unlock state after the flash operation, so that the wipe data operation caused by lock state changed can be skipped.

Reboot to Android UI
--------------------

Once the installation is complete, the device re-boots automatically. However, |C| implements the Android `Verified Boot <https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot>`_ mechanism developed by Google. We did not enroll any keys such as other commercial Android products do, so a kernelflinger warning screen is displayed before showing the traditional Android booting screen.

The first boot of the device takes time to prepare the built-in apps. Be patient, the Android home screen will show after the system boots up. The following screenshots illustrate the traditional Android tablet UI booted from a **celadon** lunch target image.

In addition to the traditional Android UI launcher, |C| supports the experimental automotive UI launcher introduced in Android 9.0 Pie. The automotive UI is enabled in the images built for **cel_kbl** and **cel_apl** lunch targets.
