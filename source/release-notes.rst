  * Recommended configuration for CPU cores & Memory allocated to Guest VM

     * CPU: [default 1 core]
     * RAM: [default 2GB]
  * Note: Allocating 100% Host resources in terms of memory and cores to
    guest is not recommended currently and it can cause instabilities.

*	Noise heard when tap/seek is performed on seekbar during Video playback.
*	Touch sound is very low while tapping on home / back button [USB Headset]
*	Glitch observed in audio playback while doing pause/play operation.
*	Audio is not heard until volume level 3
*	Audio routing fails to be expected sync device.
*	Audio is not recording with 3.5 mm Headset in gvt-d

*   When enabling GVT-d, the Guest OS may not light up the physical screen before the OS driver loads. As a result, the Guest BIOS and the Fastboot UI is not visible on the physical screen. This occurs because the physical display is initialized by the GOP driver or VBIOS before the OS driver loads, and the Guest BIOS doesn’t have them.

* Currently HDMI with stereo is enabled by default to support HDMI audio playback as there is no support for channel map, card and device detection from kernel space.

   * To test the multichannel 5.1 channel playback, use setprop vendor.audio.hdmi_multichannel 1 from adb shell and make sure to unplug and re-plug HDMI device before testing . On commercial NUC currently HDMI device port 3 is enabled.

    * The :abbr:`CaaS (Celadon as a Service)` releases are supported on Intel Platforms running Android on various Bare Metal x86 systems, Virtual Machines (KVM/Qemu), and also Containers.
    * The ingredients of the CaaS release can be used to build a service architecture, so that with customers we can deliver a **Celadon as a Service** solution.
    * These are Pre-Production CaaS Releases for evaluation and development purposes, they cannot be used for production.

Important notes and Remarks
---------------------------

This |C| build has been validated on |NUC| Kit NUC7i5DNH in the following function domains. The boot up function is supported on most Intel@ X86 platforms.
