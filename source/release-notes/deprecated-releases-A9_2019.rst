============

.. note::
    * The :abbr:`CaaS (Celadon as a Service)` releases are supported on Intel Platforms running Android on various Bare Metal x86 systems, Virtual Machines (KVM/Qemu), and also Containers.
    * The ingredients of the CaaS release can be used to build a service architecture, so that with customers we can deliver a **Celadon as a Service** solution.
    * These are Pre-Production CaaS Releases for evaluation and development purposes, they cannot be used for production.
